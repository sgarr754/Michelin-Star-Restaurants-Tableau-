# Michelin-Star Restaurants Analysis with Tableau

This project is a Tableau assignment that focused on exploring and visualizing Michelin star restaurant data across countries, cuisines, chefs, and regions.
The analysis includes interactive dashboards and charts that answer key questions about Michelin star distribution worldwide.
The following questions were included in the course assignment. 

## Tools & Skills
**Tableau:** Data visualization and dashboard design  
**Data Analysis:** Filtering, aggregation, and deriving insights  
**Dashboard Layout:** Creating multiple mobile-optimized layouts

## Project Highlights

### 1. 2–3 Star Restaurants (Highlight Table)
   On Sheet 1:
   - Create a “highlight table” that list all the restaurants that have Michelin stars.
   - Filter to show only those that have 2 and 3 stars.
   - Rename the title of your worksheet from “Sheet 1” to “2-3 Stars Restaurants”.
   - Order the list from top to bottom (i.e. 3 stars first) and indicate how many restaurants are there with 2 and 3 Michelin stars

### 2. Chefs with Michelin Stars (Tree Map)
  On Sheet 2:
  - Create a “tree map” chat that will list the Chefs with Michelin stars.
  - Exclude all null values in the graph.
  - Who are the highest and lowest ranked Michelin star chef?
  - How many stars do they have?
  - How many stars does Gordon Ramsey (the star of the popular TV show Hell’s Kitchen) have?

   **Highest ranked Michelin Stars Chef:** Heston Blumenthal  
   **Lowest ranked Michelin Stars Chef:** Vineet Bhatia  
   **Gordon Ramsay number of Michelin Stars:** 3  

### 3. Michelin Stars by Region (Horizontal Bar Chart)
  On Sheet 3:
  - Create a “horizontal bars” graph that lists all the Regions that have restaurants with Michelin stars.
  - Update the measure of “Michelin Stars” to show “count” and update the tooltip to show only Region & Count of Michelin Stars.
  - How many counts of Michelin Stars are there in North America?.
  - Rename the title of “Sheet 3” to “Michelin Stars by Region” and exclude the regions with no Michelin Stars (0.5 Mark).

   Number of Michelin Stars in North America: 23

### 4. Interactive Dashboards
  - Build and design a Dashboard using 4 charts (3 of which are built in the previous questions).
  - Build a second dashboard that is to be optimized for “iPhone 11/13 Pro Max”
   
Dashboard 1:

## Key Findings
- Developing strong skills in Tableau dashboarding and data storytelling. When it comes to creating dashboards, you're not only dragging and dropping random data and making it look pretty. It is about presenting the data clearly and meaningfully, so others can easily interpret the insights being communicated to them.
  
- Learned how to structure visualizations for both desktop and mobile platforms. Looking at how data is displayed in a mobile platform versus a desktop, I learned that not all data will be displayed well across all devices. I know that adapting your dashboard layouts differently is important to ensure readability and accessibility.
